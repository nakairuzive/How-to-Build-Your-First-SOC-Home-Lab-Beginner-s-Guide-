# How to Build Your First SOC Home Lab - Beginner's Guide
<p> If you‚Äôre new to cybersecurity and looking for a structured, beginner-friendly way to get hands-on practice, you‚Äôre in the right place.</p>

<p> In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through the exact steps to set up your first **Security Operations Centre (SOC) Home Lab**. This is one of the best ways to gain practical experience, avoid common mistakes I made starting out, and show potential employers that you‚Äôre serious about learning. </p>

<p> Building a home lab demonstrates initiative, curiosity, and persistence‚Äîall qualities that will serve you well in the cybersecurity industry. Whether you‚Äôre still figuring out your career path or already have your eye on a SOC analyst role, this is an excellent starting point.</p>

### Chapter 1: Choosing Your Virtualisation Environment

The first step is deciding where you want to host your **virtual machines (VMs)**. Virtual machines let you run multiple operating systems on a single computer.

There are many virtualisation platforms available, such as VMware Workstation, Hyper-V, and VirtualBox.

For this tutorial, we‚Äôll be using **VirtualBox** because it‚Äôs free, widely used, and beginner-friendly.

Once downloaded:

1. Open the installer from your file explorer.
2. Follow the setup wizard and install VirtualBox.
3. Launch it‚Äîyou‚Äôll use this to create and manage your virtual machines.

### Chapter 2: Preparing Your Virtual Machines

One of the frustrations I had when learning from online tutorials was being told to ‚Äúpause and download‚Äù software in the middle of the setup. To save you time, I recommend downloading everything up front.

For this beginner SOC lab, we‚Äôll use two core systems:

- **Windows 10** (for simulating endpoints and practising detection)
- **Kali Linux** (a penetration testing and security tool powerhouse)

### 2.1 Downloading and Installing Windows 10

### 2.2 Downloading and Installing Kali Linux

Next, we‚Äôll add Kali Linux to our lab.

1. Go to the [Kali Linux download page](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).
2. Under **Virtual Machines**, select the **VirtualBox image**. (This option makes setup much faster.)
